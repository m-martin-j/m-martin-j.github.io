My name is Martin Trat and I am working as a research scientist. I focus on monitoring productively used Artificial Intelligence. I plan to show some of my work and ideas on this website.

I enjoy evaluating ways to employ my data-science skills for greater good. If you like to cooperate on ways to e.g. fight the spread of misinformation, please reach out!

Also, I am a total aficionado for movies and TV shows. I might blog some about that here...
